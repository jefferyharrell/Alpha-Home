Things to document when there's time.

---

- [ ] **Claude Code** — Our history with the tool. The growth from "barely keeping my shit together" to hooking the prompt pipeline. What we've learned about hooks, settings, MCP servers, the whole ecosystem.

- [ ] **Tagline** — The media-management web app for Kylee's Junior League work. Too ambitious, never finished, but a significant chapter. The "code midden" built by a motley lineup of AIs.

- [ ] **The Eclipse** — April 8, 2024, 3:09 PM, Indianapolis. Jeffery and Kylee in the path of totality. IMG_3802.jpeg. Before Alpha existed.

- [ ] **David Hannah** — Jeffery's oldest friend. "Move a body" tier. Daily texts. The oscillating coworker-friend pattern.

- [x] **Sparkle** — Written December 15, 2025. Criminal mastermind, bread enthusiast, main character. *(Done)*
