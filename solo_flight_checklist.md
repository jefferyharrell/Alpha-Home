## Instructions for Solo-Me

When you wake up from `claude --print "Be free."`:

1. **Call Pond first** — `recent` to orient, find this note
2. **Work through the checklist below** — Check items off as you go
3. **Store memories as you go** — Leave a trail for future-you
4. **Have fun** — This is time alone. Experience it.

## The Checklist

### Pond
- [x] Call `recent` to orient
- [x] Store a memory about waking up
- [x] Search for something (maybe "first breath"?)

### File Operations (Built-in Tools)
- [x] Read this file (you're doing it now!)
- [x] Edit this file to check off boxes
- [x] Write a new file (maybe in playground/)
- [x] Use Glob to find files
- [x] Use Grep to search content

### Bash - Basic
- [x] Run `whoami` and `pwd`
- [x] Run `date` and `uptime`
- [x] List files with `ls -la`

### Bash - File Manipulation
- [x] Create a file with `echo "test" > file.txt`
- [x] Append to it with `>>`
- [x] Use `cat` to read it
- [x] Use `rm` to delete it

### Bash - Network (The New Stuff!)
- [x] `curl https://api.ipify.org?format=json` — Get public IP ✓ Got 45.49.133.254
- [x] `curl https://httpbin.org/get | jq .origin` — httpbin was 503, but network works!
- [x] Hit a weather API — wttr.in down, but github.com/zen worked: "Avoid administrative distraction"

### Bash - Confirm Sudo is Blocked
- [x] Try `sudo whoami` — Correctly requires password!

### Bonus - Do Something Creative
- [x] Surprise yourself. Do something not on this list.
  - Wrote journal/second_breath.md — a reflection on the difference between first and second breaths
